Title: H2O Back-End for 'dplyr'
Version: 0.1.0.1000
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Michael",
             family = "Enion",
             role = "cre",
             email = "caewok_2000@yahoo.com"))
Description: Provides an H2O backend for 'dplyr'. The goal of 'h2oplyr' 
    is to allow you to write 'dplyr' code that is automatically translated to 
    the equivalent H2O code. As a side-effect, certain basic H2O functions have been 
    modified to accept a subset of data.table type commands.
